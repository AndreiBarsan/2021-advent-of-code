# Andrei's 2021 Advent of Code

## Learning Goals
 - [X] Rust basics (vectors, arrays, math, etc.)
 - [X] Rust basic CLI
 - [ ] Rust linear algebra and ndarrays (e.g., https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray)
 - [ ] Rust <> C++ interop
 - [ ] Automatic linting and formatting
 - [ ] Finish all AoC problems (hints are OK from Dec 12 on, in the second half)
 - [ ] Basic unit testing

## Learnings
 - Powerful type-safe, efficient, support for ndarrays, but still at times much more verbose than numpy.
 For instance, computing the median of an array is unnecessarily complicated. Same for dealing with NaNs.
